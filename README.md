# RAG Notebooks Analysis
## Repository: [RAG-notebooks](https://github.com/IbrahimDayax/RAG-notebooks)  

---

## 1. Overview
This repository contains **eight Jupyter Notebooks** primarily focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques, integrating **LlamaIndex**, query engines, and document parsing for advanced AI-driven retrieval tasks.  

The key functionalities explored include:  
- **Query engine construction** for structured data retrieval.  
- **OCR integration** for text extraction from images.  
- **JWT decoding** for authentication-based access control.  
- **Excel-based RAG workflows** for structured data processing.

## 2. Summary of Notebooks

| **Notebook**                                      | **Description**  |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **ReAct Agent with Query Engine (RAG) Tools**    | Implements a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** agent integrated with a query engine to improve RAG-based search. |
| **RAG Query Engine Flow**                        | Develops a structured **query engine** for retrieving and processing data within an RAG pipeline. |
| **RAG Parsing Query Engine**                     | Focuses on **parsing** and preprocessing user queries for better information retrieval. |
| **Excel End to End RAG Flow**                    | Handles **Excel-based RAG workflows**, utilizing LlamaIndex for structured data extraction. |
| **End to End RAG Flow with Routing**             | Implements **intelligent routing** to optimize query handling within a RAG system. |
| **End to End RAG Flow With OCR**                 | Incorporates **OCR processing** for extracting text from images and documents within the RAG pipeline. |
| **Advanced RAG with LlamaParse on Excel**        | Uses **LlamaParse** to parse structured Excel files for enhanced RAG-based retrieval. |
| **JWT Decoder**                                  | Implements a **JWT decoder** for secure authentication and data extraction. |

## 3. Key Insights
- **LlamaIndex Integration:** Most notebooks leverage **LlamaIndex** for indexing and querying structured/unstructured data.
- **Multi-Modal Processing:** OCR techniques are used in some notebooks to extend RAG capabilities to **image-based** data.
- **Query Optimization:** Various strategies such as **intelligent routing** and **query parsing** are explored to improve RAG retrieval efficiency.
- **Authentication Handling:** One notebook focuses on **JWT decoding**, enabling authenticated access to RAG-based queries.

---

## 4. Recommendations
- **Improve Documentation:** Some notebooks have minimal markdown cells explaining their functionality. Adding structured comments would improve clarity.
- **Parameterize API Keys & Secrets:** Use environment variables instead of hardcoded API keys to prevent security risks.
- **Optimize Query Performance:** Experiment with different **vector search strategies** and embedding models for improved RAG efficiency.

---

## 5. Next Steps
- **Implement benchmarking** of different RAG strategies.
- **Test deployment** of the query engine with a real-world dataset.
- **Enhance OCR accuracy** by integrating **Tesseract improvements** or **deep learning-based text extraction**.
